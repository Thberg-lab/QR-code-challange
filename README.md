## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project, and it has been a fantastic experience. Not only did I create something that was not for myself, but I also had to think outside the box to ensure my code met the clientâ€™s requirements.


### Continued development

Moving forward, I will continue creating projects from FrontendMentor while also learning from other sources to maximize my learning curve.
